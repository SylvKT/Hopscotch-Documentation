# Hopscotch-Documentation
A full documentation of Hopscotch's hidden and visible blocks as well as a documentation for project files. This doesn't include all features yet, as this is currently a Work In Progress.
This wiki was inspired by the members of the Hopscotch forums as well as the .js file located in Hopscotch.

**Note**: The documentation is located in the [wiki](https://github.com/TehcJS/Hopscotch-Documentation/wiki).
